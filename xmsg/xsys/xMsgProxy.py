    This is a simple stateless message switch, i.e. a device that forwards
    messages without inspecting them. This simplifies dynamic discovery problem
    All xMsg clients (publishers and subscribers) connect to the proxy, instead
    of to each other. It becomes trivial to add more subscribers or publishers.
