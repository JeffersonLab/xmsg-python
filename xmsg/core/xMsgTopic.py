    """The main identification for xMsg pub/sub communications.

    xMsg is a *topic-based system*, and messages are published to given
    *topics*, or named channels, defined by *publishers*.
    *Subscribers* can received the messages published to the *topics*
    to which they are interested, by subscribing to them.

    In xMsg, a topic is composed of three parts: a *domain*, a
    *subject* and a *type*. Each part is separated by a semicolon
    character. The subject and the type can be omitted. Thus, the following
    topics are all valid:

    * *domain*
    * *domain:subject*
    * *domain:subject:type*

    The build factory method help to create a proper topic with the right
    format.

    When an xMsg actor is subscribed to a given topic, it will only receive
    messages published to that topic. To filter topics, the three  parts
    form a hierarchy, and all topics with the same prefix will be accepted.

    In other words, a subscriber listening for an specific *domain* will
    receive all messages whose topic starts with that domain, no matter the
    subject and the type. For example, if the subscription topic is "A",
    then all the messages with the following topics will be received:

    * *"A"*
    * *"A:B"*
    * *"A:C"*
    * *"A:B:1"*
    * *"A:C:1"*
    * *"A:C:2"*
    * etc...

    More specific subscriptions will not receive messages that match only the
    parent parts of the topic.
    Thus, subscription to *"A:B"* will accept *"A:B"*, *"A:B:1"*, *"A:B:2"*,
    etc, but will reject *"A"* or *"A:C"*
    Similarly, a subscription to *"A:B:1"* will only accept that exact topic,
    rejecting *"A:B:2"*, *"A:C"*, *"A"*, etc.
